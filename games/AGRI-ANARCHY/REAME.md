# AGRI-ANARCHY

**Team Members:** RITHISWARAN

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
"It's like Stardew Valley meets Overcooked,
but with chaotic weather, unpredictable markets,
pest invasions and with the added tension of defending 
your farmland from encroachin urbanization by powerful MNC’s that keep you on your toes!"

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
1.Dynamic Weather System ⛈️
oRain boosts crop growth, drought slows it down, storms can destroy fields.
oPlayers must adapt and use tools like irrigation and greenhouses.
2.Chaotic Market Economy 📈📉
oCrop prices fluctuate based on demand, random events, and player actions.
oPlayers must strategize: sell now or wait for better prices?
3.Real-Time Pest & Disaster Management 🐦🦗
oBirds, bugs, and weeds invade randomly, forcing players to react fast.
oPlayers can use scarecrows, pesticides, and farm animals to counter threats.
4.Upgrade & Expansion System 🏡
oPlayers earn money to buy better tools (tractors, automated sprinklers).
oFarms expand with new land, crops, and unique farming challenges.
5.Fatique of MNC’S📈📉  
MNC Proposals: Players receive periodic buyout offers from MNCs aiming to convert farmland into urban developments.
Accepting provides immediate financial gain but reduces available farming land, impacting long-term sustainability.
                Alliances: Forming alliances with neighboring farmers can strengthen resistance against MNC pressures,
                leading to cooperative tasks and shared resources.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
🔹 Plant seeds on available land.
🔹 Manage crops by watering, dealing with pests, and reacting to weather changes.
🔹 Harvest fully grown crops and decide when to sell based on market conditions.
🔹 Sell crops to earn money, but be mindful of price fluctuations.
🔹 Upgrade & Expand to handle more crops, automate tasks, and unlock new abilities.
Challenges: Weather unpredictability, price crashes, pest outbreaks, and time-limited special events.
Rewards: More efficient farming tools, rare crops, and unlocking new farming strategies.                Decision Making:Evaluate MNC offers and threats, deciding when to fight, negotiate, or adapt.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

2.Mid-Term Goals:
oUpgrade tools & unlock new crops.
oLearn the economy to maximize profits.
3.Long-Term Goals:
1.Expand farm, automate systems, and master the perfect farming cycle.
2.Survive multiple in-game seasons with increasingly difficult challenges.
       4.   Strategic Planning: 
          1.    Developing and implementing strategies to protect land, such as legal defenses or community initiatives, provides depth and ongoing engagement.
General Scope:
Small prototype focuses on basic mechanics (planting, growing, selling).
Expanded version adds deeper weather, economy, and upgrade progression.
